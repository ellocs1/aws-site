											            <p><strong>Welcome to my blog!</strong></p>
												                <p>On this site, I will talk about my journey in learning DevOps.</p>
														            <p>This site is my learning step in getting to know AWS and showing my evolution in learning DevOps!</p>

																		                <h2>About Me</h2>
																					                <p>My name is Alex, I‚Äôm 21 years old, born in Romania and currently studying at Ia»ôi, Management at the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University, FEAA, in my 2nd year.</p>
																							            <p>After a couple of months in the first year, I realized that this is not what I would like to do in my life. My hobby since I was little was computers and everything related to them, so in my 1st year I started to learn Python through the Python Programming MOOC ‚Äî a course created by the Agile Education Research group of the University of Helsinki.</p>
																								                <p>In the meantime, every morning I was going to university classes, and in the evening, I was doing the Python tasks. At night I trained with an esports team (Nexus Talents, academy of one of the best Counter-Strike teams in Romania), which helped me gain teamwork experience, learning how to be more focused and how to be more communicative with the team.</p>
																										            <p>On that online course, I got my first certificate for Python, which motivated me to continue in this field.</p>
																											                <p>Sadly (or maybe not!), I left that esports team to start focusing on DevOps. My first steps were learning Linux and how to be efficient with it. Then I started to learn scripting with Bash and how to use Git. These steps gave me confidence because I learned fast and started uploading scripts to GitHub. Even the very simple script meant a lot to me. </p>

																																	                </blockquote>
																																							                <h2>Current Learning</h2>
																																									            <p>Then I started the course for AWS Cloud Practitioner, which I‚Äôm still learning (as of <b>May 2025</b>) and preparing for the exam.</p>
																																										                <p>In the meantime, I was also thinking that it‚Äôs better to get practice of using AWS by doing this site instead of just learning.</p>

																																																                </blockquote>
																																																		            <p>All of this was done by <b>May 10, 2025</b>, and I will keep updating this blog with the new things I learn.</p>
